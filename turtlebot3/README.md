### this is a log for working with the rasp pi b+ for turtlebot3

#### I brought a pi3B+ home to test

here is what I have done so far:
* downloaded Mate 18.04 64bit image for pi 3B + from Ubuntu Mate website
* used pi-imager to load the image to SD card
* open MATE desktop and it seems to work, graphics are terribly slow
* i install ros successfully and tested roscore
* i did some other things then it crashed, this seems to be a common brought

I think that we should just stay headless and I predict that issue will go away, but we will see.

lets ttry that again:
* download Mate 18.04 64bit image for pi 3B + from Ubuntu Mate website
* used pi-imager to load the image to SD card
* use GUI to setup account and keyboard yada yada
* do not login into desktop, press: 'ctrl+alt+f1' to open a terminal
* login as your user, not root for now


* update the repository list - no need to upgrade

  `sudo apt update`

* install SSH for remote connection - this is already install on Mate image

  `sudo apt install openssh-server`

* test connectivity

  `ip a`

  check that you get a valid ip address - take a picture of the terminal!

  try to ping the pi from a remote computer (on the network)

  `ping 192.168.xxx.yy`

  you should get byte transferred as shown below

  `PING 192.168.254.22 (192.168.254.22) 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from 192.168.254.22: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.599 ms
  64 bytes from 192.168.254.22: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.620 ms
  64 bytes from 192.168.254.22: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.624 ms`

  next try to ssh in from the remote computer. Make sure openssh-server is on both machines

  `ssh <user on pi>@<ip of pi>`

  ssh was not working, so... I made some changes to /etc/ssh/sshd_config THIS WAS NOT THE FIX
  the fix is much easier, just run this on the host (the pi) and you should be good to go

  `sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server`

  finally test that you can connect to the pi from the control computer
  notice how it shows that you have changed computers

  `thill@T1600-brwn305:~$ ssh thill@192.168.254.22`

  this means that you are in, woop woop!

  now would be a good time to make a backup image... lol

  install ROS following  the steps here http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu but do them through ssh

  then setup a workspace for ros called 'pi_ros'

``` ~$ mkdir -p ~/pi_ros/src
  ~$ cd pi_ros/
  ~/pi_ros$ catkin_make
  ~/$ echo "~/pi_ros/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/pi_ros/devel/setup.bash
  ```



  your workspace should compile without errors

  now install the turtlebot3 packeges following this https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/raspberry_pi_3_setup/ (SBC setup)

   SKIP 1) Install Ubuntu MATE on TurtleBot PC - we already did this 'manually'

   SKIP 2) Install ROS on TurtleBot PC - we already did this 'manually'

   START 3) Install Dependent Packages on TurtleBot PC - replace all instances of 'kinetic' with 'melodic'

      download the drivers from github, make sure you are in `~/pi_ros/src`  before you clone the repo

      ``` $ cd ~/pi_ros/src
      $ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/hls_lfcd_lds_driver.git
      $ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
      $ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
      ```

      go into turtlbot3 and delete some stuff (I am not sure why I am just following)

      ``` $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3
      $ rm -r turtlebot3_description/ turtlebot3_teleop/ turtlebot3_navigation/ turtlebot3_slam/ turtlebot3_example/
      ```

      install some Packages (changed kinetic to melodic)

      `
      $ sudo apt install ros-melodic-rosserial-python ros-melodic-tf
      `

      backout to the top of the workspace and build with catkin_make (what is -j1 ?)

      `
      $ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make -j1
     `
