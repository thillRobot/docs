TWH ROS LOG - 07/22/2017 

To Accomplish: 	- Main Goal - Get the Open CV working with ROS 


Done: openCV is installed (by default) and updated in ubuntu

	- demo program 'image_converter.cpp' is built and works

	- modified demo program 'line_detection.cpp' is built and works

	Try This:

		Turn on the camera

		$ roslaunch ttu_camera view_camera.launch	

		You should see the video in the 'image_view' window

		$ rosrun ttu_camera image_converter

		Now you should see the video in the 'image window'

		$ rosrun ttu_camera line_detection


		
	Next Goal - Do some more awesome stuff with open cv at the home crib lab!

		  - Goal: Make it easier to switch networks/locations/remote versus local

			-subgoal: pass in ROS_MASTER_URI /ROS_HOSTNAME as command line parameters to the launches - Working, but needs to be tested with other machines.

				-issue1: There is no image shown in the window when on the local machine. What has changed? - FIXED
