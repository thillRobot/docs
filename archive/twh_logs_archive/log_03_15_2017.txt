TWH ROS LOG - 03/15/2017 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL : Implement Nav Stack on the LX (it is finally working !)


		1) make a map with the LX again, a clean one hopefully.

			i) ssh thill@robot$ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_drive.launch
					 			
			ii) ssh thill@robot$ cd ~/ttu_ros
					   $ rosbag record -O labmap /RosAria/S3Series_1_laserscan /tf

			   Now, starting at the origin record a map using keyboard drive

	
		-> CLOSE BOTH PROCESSES		

		-> $ roscore

		-> $ rosparam set use_sim_time true
				
		-> $ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=/RosAria/S3Series_1_laserscan _odom_frame:=odom

		-> $ rosbag play --clock labmap.bag

		-> WAIT FOR IT TO MAKE THE MAP

		-> $ rosrun map_server map_saver -f labmap

		-> NOW YOU CAN CLOSE ALL PROCESSES, you should have a map call 'labmap.pgm'	



		2) try to use the map to navigate with AMCL

		-> $ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_config.launch

		-> $ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_move_base.launch 

		3) now turn on rviz remotely

		-> $ roslaunch lx_control lx_control.launch


		The robot can now go to a goal. I accomplished this by moving to the 'new way' of setting the costmap params as opposed to the 'pre-hydro' way
		I started with just the static map, but this has no dynamic obstacle avoidance. Next is to turn that on an tune the params.


		I have now added the 'obstacles' layer back into the the costmap. This working but the robot has trouble in tight spaces. There are 4 yaml file in which to set the params for navigatio. Still to do is to really figure out how they all work together. Good thing I finally figured out how to use the layer 'plugins'. Woop Woop.
