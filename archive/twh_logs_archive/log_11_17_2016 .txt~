TWH ROS LOG - 11/16/2016 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL : Have turtlebotsim stage have and move simple objects (DONE in a simple way, needs work)	

	1) learn TF, start with the tutorials

		http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/

		we made a launch file to do everything 

		$ roslaunch learning_tf start_demo.launch

	2) learn basic shapes (markers in rviz)
 		
		http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/Tutorials/Markers%3A%20Basic%20Shapes

		we made a launch file for this too

		$ roslaunch using_markers markers_demo.launch

		to see the marker you may need to 'add' a marker in the rviz GUI


	3) now we need to bring this together with turtlebotsim_stage !


		lets make a new node (.cpp program) inside of our using markers folder  

		the goal of this node is to listen to the pose of the robot and have a block exist in this pose with an offset.

		Well that was way easier than I thought it would be. Check out this.

		$ roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch
		$ rosrun using_markers turtlebot_shapes
		
		Now if add a marker it should be on the robot ! And if you close the second terminal it will drop the marker!

		Or use this to start it all at once (notice the launch inside of launch in this last one)

		$ roslaunch using_markers markers_turtlebot.launch
