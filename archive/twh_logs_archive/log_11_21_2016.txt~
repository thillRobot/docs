TWH ROS LOG - 11/21/2016 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL (working) : Have turtlebot start in one corner. And a block (marker) starts in the other. Send it towards the block with rviz (or a script), and when the robot reaches certain proximity 'aquire' he object by reassigning frames. 


This is working on a very simple level. The block is placed in the map, the robot is placed in the map. If you drive on top of the block (dist<1.0) then the robot will 'pick up' the block. This done by changing the broadcasted transform to the frame /payload. After you pick up the payload, you can drive to the 'depot' and 'drop off the payload.


	$ roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch
	$ rosrun using_markers gripper
