TWH ROS LOG - 10/27/2016 

 to do: 1) Turtlebot Simulator Map Files 

		a) figure out my map file bug on the work laptop ( researcher3-LattitudeXT )

		b) move the map files into the workspace ( ~/catkin_ws )	

	2) 'publish' a goal to turtlebot sim (currently we are using a 'service')


 log:


	1a) fix map file bug -> i think the update fixed it

		In a fresh terminal 
		

		$ sudo apt-get install python-rosdep python-wstool ros-indigo-ros

		$ sudo rosdep init
		
		$ rosdep update


		$ sudo apt-get update	

		$ sudo apt-get check (not needed but can check for error w/o internet I think)

		$ roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch
	
		This should load the turtlebot simulator in the default map. The 'export' commands should not be needed 		until we build a new map.


	1b) move map files (http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_stage/Tutorials/indigo/Customizing%20the%20Stage%20Simulator)
		
		go to the (cd - change directory) the installation directory 

		$ cd /opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_stage/maps
	
		check that you can see the files here (.yaml, .map, .png)

		$ ls


		Make a directory in your workspace to put your world in.

		$ mkdir ~/catkin_ws/maps

		Copy the default files to your workspace (3 files). You can choose a new name

		$ cp maze.png ~/catkin_ws/maps/ttu_maze.png
		$ cp maze.yaml ~/catkin_ws/maps/ttu_maze.yaml
		$ cp stage/maze.world ~/catkin_ws/maps/ttu_maze.world

		Set these new files as the world

		$ export TURTLEBOT_STAGE_MAP_FILE="~/catkin_ws/maps/ttu_maze.png"
		$ export TURTLEBOT_STAGE_WORLD_FILE="~/catkin_ws/maps/ttu_maze.world"

		$ roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch

		We need to check that we are actually using the correct world! To do this we should modify the map.png file and check that it works. I am going to use GIMP.

		There are a few steps we need to take to modify the stock map
		
			i) edit the ttu_maze.yaml file ( 1 line)

				$ gedit ~/catkin_ws/maps/ttu_maze.yaml

				Change 'maze.png' to 'ttu_maze.png' and save

			ii) edit the ttu_maze.world file (2 lines)

				$ gedit ~/catkin_ws/maps/ttu_maze.world	
	
				...
				name "maze"
  				bitmap "../maze.png"
				...

				to 
				...	
				name "ttu_maze"
  				bitmap "../ttu_maze.png"	
				...
		

		
		
		





		






	2) publish a goal

	start here: 

	http://answers.ros.org/question/104321/how-to-publish-a-navigation-goal-to-turtlebot-running-the-amcl_demolaunch-navigation-with-a-map-file/

that page suggests doing this:

rostopic pub /move_base_simple/goal geometry_msgs/PoseStamped '{ header: {stamp: now, frame_id: "map"}, pose: { position: {x: -4.560, y: 0.204, z: 0.0}, orientation: {w: 1.0}}}'

	



 edits to make: 

		-> ROS is a framework! not an OS

		-> rocon is a multimaster framework (man, I though multi nodes and packages was cray!)
