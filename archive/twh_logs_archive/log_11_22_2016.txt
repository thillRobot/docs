TWH ROS LOG - 11/22/2016 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL (working) : 

 start with this from last ime

	$ roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage.launch
	$ rosrun using_markers gripper


 maybe we should make a class for doing just this
 i think our code is already really messy  

	$ rosrun using_markers class_shapes 


 ) before we make a class we should just write a function, duh

	What is it going to look like? Prototype

		
	





I) lets make multiple blocks first, at that point it must be messy enough

II) or maybe ....
