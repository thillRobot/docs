    Processing the pointcloud data from the aubo Arm and the rpLidar ... Things are getting cool!

    The paper (IDETC) deadline is rapidly approaching (02/13/2018). The paper has not been written, but the code (the meat) is mostly there. Today I am beginning to implement the 'iterative closest point' algorithm with is inlcuded in PCL. 


Try this:
    
    For testing the Sample ICP code from the PCL tutoruials website we need some decent sample data. Here is the current workflow.


    1) Generate a .stl file of the 'target'. This is a CAD model of the know geometery. (I did this on my CAE windows machine in solidworks 2015) 

    2) Convert the .stl file into a .ply using 'Meshlab' with 'import mesh' and then 'save as'. Open this through the terminal,  $ meshlab 

    3) Now, we can make a .pcd with the sample code from PCL (these almost work!)

       $ rosrun cad2cloud cad2cloud /home/thill/Dropbox/m73_ros/src/cad2cloud/images/input.ply 10000 0.01 output.pcd

       $ rosrun cad2cloud cad2cloud /home/bender/Dropbox/t410_ros/src/cad2cloud/images/input.obj 10000 0.01 output.pcd




 This is SOOOO close, I am doing something wrong but I am not sure what it is!!! - it seams like it should be working but the output file is not showing up! - AHHHH!!!
 $ rosrun cad2cloud cad2cloud /home/bender/Dropbox/t410_ros/src/cad2cloud/images/scenario1.ply /home/bender/Dropbox/t410_ros/src/cad2cloud/images/output.pcd -n_samples 100000 -leaf_size 0.5


 OK, Now it is working. It had to do with the 'normals' I think, but I have not verified the exact reason.  

 Try this and it should work!
