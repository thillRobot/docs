TWH ROS LOG - 08/12/2017



  Goal: continue with the rtabmap tutorials

   THis should work with a single launch file! MAKE THAT HAPPEN!:

        ON THE ROBOT COMPUTER (the kinect is plugged into the external usb port on LX)

        thill@robot:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera lx_3dmap.launch

	ON THE LOCAL COMPUTER

       	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.100.66.13:11311
        thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=robotlab-t1600
       	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_IP=149.149.151.59

	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rgb_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image depth_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image_depth camera_info_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_camera_info compressed:=true rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start"

	Now you should see the mapping in the rtabmapviz window! Woop Woop!

	To do next: Figure out why my launch file (start_rtabmap.launch) is not working.



        TRY THIS: (not working either)


	ON THE ROBOT COMPUTER (the kinect is plugged into the external usb port on LX)

        thill@robot:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera lx_3dmap.launch

	ON THE LOCAL COMPUTER

       	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.100.66.13:11311
	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=robotlab-t1600
       	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_IP=149.149.151.59

	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rgb_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image depth_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image_depth camera_info_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_camera_info compressed:=true rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start" visual_odometry:=false odom_topic:="/odom"
