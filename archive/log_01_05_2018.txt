TWH ROS LOG - 01/05/2018 

  Goal: Use the 'laser_geometry' package to make a 3D point cloud from a tilting scanning laser ranger (Hokuyo)

  We are getting closer - not quite there yet!

Try this in separate terminals:

    $ roscore

    $ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM1

    $ rosrun scan2cloud tilt_servo

    $ roslaunch scan2cloud scan2cloud.launch

The laser projection to pointcloud isnt working yet! It will be soon...
