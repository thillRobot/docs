TWH ROS LOG - 08/08/2017 

  

  NEW BIG GOAL! - Get rtabmap_ros working - This is a ROS wrapper on the 'rtabmap' (real time appearence based mapping) RGB-D 3D SLAM algorithm 

  http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros

  We are going to start with the Kinect (ros-freenect) on the Desktop, hopefully we will move to LX soon.
   
I am going to go through some of the tutorials
1) http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros/Tutorials/HandHeldMapping

Pretty quick I ran into an error! But I think I have gotten around it!


thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera start_kinect.launch
 
This works fine!

thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start"

This does not!

/opt/ros/indigo/lib/rtabmap_ros/rgbd_odometry: error while loading shared libraries: librtabmap_core.so.0.11: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
followed by a bunch of evil red ink!

I have found a workaround in several places ont he web, 

" This error happens when the linker cannot find the library on runtime in the standard paths. The rtabmap library uses multi-arch installation, so it would be installed in /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu instead of /opt/ros/kinetic/lib.

For some reasons, the library paths may not be correctly set on a fresh install. Make sure to source the setup.bash in your catkin devel workspace, it sometimes add lib/x86_64-linux-gnu to LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. If not automatically added, you can add it manually (or add this line at the end of your "~/.bashrc"):

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu "


SO TRY THIS! export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/ros/indigo/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

I am adding this into the launch file so I dont have to do it in .bashrc or manually

    thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera start_kinect.launch

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/ros/indigo/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

    thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start"

    now close both terminals

    thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ rtabmap-databaseViewer ~/.ros/rtabmap.db

    go to view>3D view then you have to navigate around to see the map!
  
    the go to file->export 3D map-> and save it somewhere

    then open 'meshlab' it can be installed with apt-get, file->import mesh-> pick your file and see how awesome it is
