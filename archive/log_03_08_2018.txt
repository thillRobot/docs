    Processing the pointcloud data from the aubo Arm and the rpLidar and CAD files ... Things are getting cool!

   1) First make simple CAD drawings in 'freeCAD' - this is really a terrible cad program but it can output 'mesh' file formats (.ply, .obj, ...)

   2) in the CAD window, 'ctrl-a' to select the entire part, then >>file>>export, and choose to export as a .ply file

   3) now convert the new cad files (scene1,2,3) into .pcd files using my ros node shown below (this still needs some polishing)

    .../images$ rosrun cad2cloud cad2cloud /home/thill/Dropbox/m73_ros/src/cad2cloud/images/scene1.ply output.pcd -n_samples 100000 -leaf_size 0.001 -write_normals 1 -no_vis_results 0

   4) now look to see that is worked

 .../images$ pcl_viewer -multiview 1 output.pcd

    OK, this still works! good!


   Seam Detection with RANSAC - find the intersectionand line(s) between three planes (notice the thresh is a little higher on this one)

   SCENE1:  
   $ roslaunch seam_detection seam_detection_RANSAC.launch in_file:="lidar_scene1.pcd" thresh:=0.005  

   This is an image from the lab of real steel

 

   Seam Detection with ICP - find the intersection and line(s) between three planes - These are both working but it is not perfect yet!

     
     SCENE1:
     $ roslaunch seam_detection seam_detection_ICP.launch lidar_file:="lidar_scene1.pcd" cad_file:="cad_scene1.pcd"  thresh:=0.003
 
     SCENE2:
     $ roslaunch seam_detection seam_detection_ICP.launch lidar_file:="lidar_scene2.pcd" cad_file:="cad_scene2.pcd"  thresh:=0.003







    CLOCK SKEW BUG FIX! http://embeddedbuzz.blogspot.in/2012/03/make-warning-clock-skew-detected-your.html


    if this happens when you try to catkin_make ; make[1]: warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete.
     
    this is easy to fix (it happens when you reset the clock sometimes) 

    cd to the ws you want to fix and do this:

    $ sudo find . -exec touch {} \;

    now you should be able to make just fine!
