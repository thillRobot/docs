TWH ROS LOG - 08/07/2017 

  
     I have finshed moving the 'catkin_workspaces' of all computers into my dropbox folder for backup security and ease of access. Now I can vim to remote edit 'or' just edit remotely and let dropbox sync the files. I have used a simple convention for naming the workspaces.

     robotlab-t1600 workspace is : t1600_ros    
     bender-t410    workspace is : t410_ros
     robot (lx)     workspace is : lx_ros      (this one kinda breaks the rule but we are going to go with it for now)

    This took a little doing... The one thing that I forgot was that 'rosaria' had been built from source so I had to reinstall it without 'apt-get'. Follow the instructions here: http://wiki.ros.org/ROSARIA/Tutorials/How%20to%20use%20ROSARIA


Trying to get kinect working on the lx - problems right from the start

I installed freenect-stack no problem but then this!

thill@robot:~/Dropbox$ roslaunch freenect_launch freenect.launch

thill@robot:~/Dropbox$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/depth/image
[ INFO] [1502119622.449855988]: Using transport "raw"
[ERROR] [1502119623.733336869]: Unable to convert '32FC1' image for display: 'cv_bridge.cvtColorForDisplay() while trying to convert image from '32FC1' to 'bgr8' an exception was thrown ([32FC1] is not a color format. but [bgr8] is. The conversion does not make sense)'


So we need to figure this out!

 So it does work when viewing on the control computer. I believe this is the same atom32 cant do graphics! Why me! 


Try this with the Kinect plugged into the external ESB port on the LX:
         
              ON THE ROBOT 

                     	thill@robot: $ roslaunch ttu_camera start_kinect.launch

              ON THE CONTROL COMPUTER

			thill@robotlab-t1600: $ roslaunch ttu_camera view_kinect.launch

	      Now you should see the depth image in the 'image-view' window.

This leaves the real question. Can we make 3D maps using the Kinect and the LX ??? I hope so!
      

Also, lx_drive and lx_teleop are acting funny together, we need to figure this out as well!
