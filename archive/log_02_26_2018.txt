    Processing the pointcloud data from the aubo Arm and the rpLidar ... Things are getting sharper!

    Also, we (I mean Stephen Z.) have tuned the robot so the scans are improved. The '2 planes' issue seems to be gone. 
    
    The newest scan files are: "test_cloud14.pcd" and "test_cloud15.pcd"      


Try this:
    
    Process the pointcloud using PCL 

        $ roslaunch seam_detection segment_plane_line.launch in_file:="test_cloud15.pcd" thresh:=0.003

        
   Because there are multiple planes (more than 3) in these new files the seam detection is sensitive to teh filtering and the threshold. 


And now what... adding 'visualization markers' for the planes in rviz to reduce the topic load hopefully - it seems to be working but is not done.
