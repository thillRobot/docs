    Processing the pointcloud data from the aubo Arm and the rpLidar ...

Try this:

    I now have multiple plane detection working. Here is the full work flow to test the process.


    Step 1) Record a pointcloud with the Aubo Arm

        // turn on the robot
        $ roslaunch aubo_control main.launch

        // start the conversion // SUPER NEW STUFF - I Changed how the concatenation, the range filter, and the voxel filter works!
        $ roslaunch scan2cloud scan2cloud_supernew.launch  

        // move the robot
        $ rosrun goalpoint_generator lidar_scan


        // and when you are happy save the cloud to a .pcd file
        $ rosrun pcl_ros pointcloud_to_pcd input:=/cloud_out

        // You should see a .pcd in the current directory

        // Now you can look at the .pcd with pcl_viewer 

        $ pcl_viewer -multiview 1 1516917376914132.pcd

     
    Step 2) Process the pointcloud using PCL 

        $ roslaunch seam_detection segment_plane_line.launch in_file:="test_cloud10.pcd" thresh:=0.01
