   Seam Detection with RANSAC - improved plane filter - thick thin double filter

   SCENE1:  
   $ roslaunch seam_detection seam_detection_RANSAC.launch in_file:="lidar_scene1.pcd" thresh1:=0.01 thresh2:=0.001

   It seems to be working better, I theoretically have 1mm planes now, with fancy markers...
