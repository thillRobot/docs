TWH ROS LOG - 09/13/2017 

  

  Goal: continue with the rtabmap - The Goal is to merge the 2D nav with the 3D mapping


	To Figure Out: WHy is the laserscan jumping around so much? Also what is up with the ghost frame that jumps around, is this the same issue?

		The answer I think is here at the bottom of the page: http://wiki.ros.org/amcl

	Also: There is a discrepancy with /sonar_frame and /sonar - for some reason rviz wants /sonar and everybody else want /sonar_frame
