TWH ROS LOG - 12/01/2016 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL : develop a class to help 'part handling'





	Accomplished : Send the robot to a series of goals that are stored in an array. Not perfect but it is working!
 
			To do this I have made a 'turtlebot_task' class. 			
		

			$roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage 
			
			$rosrun turtlebot_payload turtlebot_task
