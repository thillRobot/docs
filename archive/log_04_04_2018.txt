 BIG NEWS! - I have moved my ThinkPad T410 to Ubuntu16 and ROS Kinetic!
           - There were a few bumps but it seems to be pretty nice!

 Also, I ma working on 'Apriltags' for the 'cube sat' senior design group, this is coming along
 	
	- I got opencv3 working in Kinetic

	- I pulled the source from git for 'apriltags2_ros' and it built with no problems

	- Now the task is to test it out, this is coming along

        Try This: 

		$ roslaunch ttu_opencv line_detection.launch
		
		$ roslaunch apriltags2_ros continuous_detection.launch camera_name:="usb_cam_node"

         This is working but the camera needs to be calibrated!
