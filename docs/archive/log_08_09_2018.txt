  Goal: re-learn ROS-KINECT

      - There are several packages and two main drivers I think. The goal is to learn about this and sort it out.
      - freenect
      - openni
      - openni2


      This Works -

        thill@researcher-ThinkCentre-M73:~$ roslaunch ttu_opencv start_kinect.launch

      But no visuals appear.


      We get a video with this at least...

        thill@researcher-ThinkCentre-M73:~$ roslaunch ttu_opencv view_kinect_local.launch
