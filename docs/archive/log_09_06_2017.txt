TWH ROS LOG - 08/24/2017 

  

  Goal: continue with the rtabmap tutorials 

   THis should work with a single launch file! MAKE THAT HAPPEN!:

        ON THE ROBOT COMPUTER (the kinect is plugged into the external usb port on LX)

        thill@robot:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera lx_3dmap.launch

	ON THE LOCAL COMPUTER

       	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.100.66.70:11311
	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=robotlab-t1600
       	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_IP=149.149.151.59

	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rgb_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image depth_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image_depth camera_info_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_camera_info compressed:=true rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start"
	
	Now you should see the mapping in the rtabmapviz window! Woop Woop!
	Close the terminals and then do this.

	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ rtabmap-databaseViewer ~/.ros/rtabmap.db

	You can now save the file as a .ply and open it with 'meshlab'

	To do next: Figure out why my launch file (start_rtabmap.launch) is not working.



	THIS WORKS NOW! But why do I have to set the ROS_MASTER_URI outside of the launch file?	

	ON THE ROBOT COMPUTER (the kinect is plugged into the external usb port on LX)

        thill@robot:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera lx_3dmap.launch

	ON THE LOCAL COMPUTER

	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.100.66.70:11311
       	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera start_rtabmap.launch

	
	AND THIS WORKS NOW TOO!!!

	ON THE ROBOT COMPUTER - The Remote Computer Env. vars are now set in ~/.bashrc instead of in the launch file. This fixed my launch file problem!

        thill@robot:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera lx_3dmap_visual.launch

	ON THE LOCAL COMPUTER

       	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera start_rtabmap_visual.launch

	Now we can push forward!
