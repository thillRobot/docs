TWH ROS LOG - 06/09/2018

  

  Goal: continue with the rtabmap - The Goal is to merge the 2D nav with the 3D mapping


	Minor Goal: View the 3D mapping in rviz

	ON THE ROBOT COMPUTER 

	    thill@robot:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera lx_3dmap.launch	

	ON THE LOCAL COMPUTER

       	thill@researcher-ThinkCentre-M73:~$ roslaunch ttu_opencv start_rtabmap_rviz.launch

	


	We can control the Kinect Motors Too!
	
	Install a new 

	$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-kinect-aux

	Turn on the Node

	$ roscore

	$ rosrun kinect_aux kinect_aux_node

	Publish a topic to choose the tilt

	$ rostopic pub /tilt_angle std_msgs/Float64 -- 0
	


	TO DO NEXT:

	Figure out why the /base_link is not on the map floor - this tf doesnt show up in lx_setup_tf like the others

	I think this is done. The /base_link is on on the floor of the map.
