TWH ROS LOG - 03/16/2017 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL : Learn more about the Nav Stack using the LX, layers plugings, parameter tuning

		1) I have learned that you have to watch for noise in the map. I found pixels that were occupied that shold not. 

		2) The robot is very sensitive to the costmap parameters when working in a tight space 

		3) I am trying to implement the new global planner called 'global_planner' next maybe 'teb_planner'

			'global_planner' is now the base_global_planner, in my opinion A* works best
				-> set params in global_planner_params.yaml (new)

			next is o try teb_local_planer
