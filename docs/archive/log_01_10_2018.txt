TWH ROS LOG - 01/10/2018 

  Goal: Use the 'laser_geometry' package to make a 3D point cloud from a tilting scanning laser ranger (Hokuyo)

    It is finally working but the transforms from the 'robot arm' (rc servo arm) are very sloppy. I am blaming the error mainly on this.  

Now try this in separate terminals:

    $ roslaunch scan2cloud tilt_servo.launch

    $ roslaunch scan2cloud scan2cloud.launch

You can see the laser projection to pointcloud is working and the clouds are merged into one cloud in the map frame. 

Now save the merged cloud into a .pcd file. It will have a file name based on the timestamp

    $ rosrun pcl_ros pointcloud__pcd input:=/cloud_out

Now you should be able to look at the cloud with 'pcl-viewer' (outside of ros)

    $ pcl_viewer -multiview 1 1515564128591685.pcd 



Also try this! I have messed with the servos some, with some improvements....

    $ roslaunch scan2cloud test_servo.launch

    $ roslaunch scan2cloud scan2cloud.launch
