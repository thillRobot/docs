TWH ROS LOG - 04/05/2017 	

		To Do:
				
		Improve and tune Autonomous mapping (explore).

		based on Frontier Exploration package: http://wiki.ros.org/frontier_exploration

		loosely copied tutorial which uses 'navigation_stage'

		Start here:
		
			To test run these launches on the robot (ssh thill@lx_robot)
						
			$ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_config.launch

			$ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_explore.launch
'
			Then run rviz on the control computer, 			
						
			$ roslaunch lx_control lx_explore_control.launch
		
			Follow the instructions using 'clicked point' in the GUI	

			This is working but it need tuning and testing.

		        Now we need to save the map 

			on the robot (ssh thill@lx_robot)

			$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f newmap
			
			Now you should see 'newmap.pgm' in the folder that you started in 

		Note: the weird costmap bug was fixed with 'laser_filters' pkg, to do this i created 'laser_config.yaml'




	TO DO STILL:

		1) make the explore_costmap_params.yaml file work. Currently explore only works when the params are defined in lx_explore.launch. When I try i gut this error:

		Please use the 'Point' tool in Rviz to select an exporation boundary.

		[ WARN] [1491408248.063246192]: Could not get robot pose, cancelling pose reconfiguration


		2) tune and or figure out why the robot crashes during exploration
