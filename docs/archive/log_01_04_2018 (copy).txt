TWH ROS LOG - 01/04/2018 

  Goal: Use the 'laser_geometry' package to make a 3D point cloud from a tilting scanning laser ranger (Hokuyo)

    
  try this:

  First power on the laser (12v) and plug in the USB

  For now we have to give ACM0 dial permissions - (Needs to be fixed)
   
  Check the permissions
  $ ls -l /dev/ttyACM0 

  Change the permissions (only needed after being unplugged or powered off)
  $ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

  Launch our new node!
  $ roslaunch scan2cloud scan2cloud.launch

  Now you should be able to see both the '/scan' and the '/cloud'


  What's Next: 'tilt' the laser and make some 3d data
