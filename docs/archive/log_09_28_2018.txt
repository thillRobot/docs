    Processing the pointcloud data from the aubo Arm and the rpLidar plus CAD models ... Things are getting cooooolller!!!!!!

    Import a cloud from a CAD model. Currently it works like this - from Solidworks(.stl)-->meshlab(.ply)-->cad2cloud(.pcd)-->ROS(pointcloud!)

 Try this! Woop!

 Step1) Make a part in your CAD program of choice. This part will become the 'reference cloud'. Save the file as a '.stl' file. If your CAD program can create a '.ply' or '.pcd' file you can skip steps 2 or 3 respectively.

 Step2) Convert the '.stl' to a '.ply' file using meshlab. Open the '.stl' using 'import mesh' and save it as a '.ply' file.

 Step3) Convert the '.ply' to a '.pcd' file using cad2cloud (this is a package I wrote that uses PCL). run the following commands.

        $ rosrun cad2cloud cad2cloud /home/thill/Dropbox/m73_ros/src/cad2cloud/images/input.ply output.pcd -n_samples 100000 -leaf_size 0.001 -write_normals 1 -no_vis_results 0

        $ pcl_viewer -multiview 1 output.pcd

 Step4) Use ICP to campare the CAD/reference image to the LIDAR/source image. The LIDAR '.pcd' file must also be in the image directory.

        SCENE1:
        $ roslaunch seam_detection seam_detection_ICP.launch lidar_file:="lidar_scene1.pcd" cad_file:="cad_scene1.pcd"  thresh:=0.003

        SCENE2:
        $ roslaunch seam_detection seam_detection_ICP.launch lidar_file:="lidar_scene2.pcd" cad_file:="cad_scene2.pcd"  thresh:=0.003

        SCENE3:
        $ roslaunch seam_detection seam_detection_ICP.launch lidar_file:="lidar_scene3.pcd" cad_file:="cad_scene3.pcd"  thresh:=0.003

        SCENE3+4:
        $ roslaunch seam_detection seam_detection_ICP.launch lidar_file:="lidar_scene3.pcd" cad_file:="cad_scene4.pcd"  thresh:=0.003
