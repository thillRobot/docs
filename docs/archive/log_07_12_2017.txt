TWH ROS LOG - 07/12/2017 

To Accomplish: 	- Main Goal - Get the Axis Network Camera Working in ROS

		- it is working but I cannot veiw the video in RVIZ - GOAL

		- sub goal- launch file for axis camera - DONE!

		to view the camera with 'image_view' do this:

		
		on the robot (computer with the camera)

		$ roslaunch ttu_camera start_camera.launch

		on the remote computer (where you want to see the image)

		$ roslaunch ttu_camera view_camera.launch

		now you should see the video live in the 'image view' window and in rviz !

                Well now we need a new goal! Apparently not yet, something has broken!
		The only thing that has changed is that I install find_object_2d
		the topic changed names so .... it works now but we need to figure that out
