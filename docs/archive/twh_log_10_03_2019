Setting up the LX Robot - Again - Re-born Again, Again!

1) install clean MATE 16.04

	thill@lx-robot:~$ lsb_release -a
		No LSB modules are available.
		Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
		Description:	Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
		Release:	16.04
		Codename:	xenial

2) tried to install caja-dropbox - did not work - gave up quick

3) install ROS kinetic (http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

3) download install ARIA libraries - instructions here ( http://wiki.ros.org/ROSARIA/Tutorials/How%20to%20use%20ROSARIA#Install_ARIA_and_Build_ROSARIA)

	this requires .deb file for aria - this is no longer available online !!!
	Reed Hedges has the source on GIT (https://github.com/reedhedges/AriaCoda.git) 		- it makes but i dont know how to install it, maybe i should ask him

	$ sudo dpkg -i libaria_2.9.1+ubuntu16_i368.deb

4) download and install (from source) ROSARIA package

	$ cd ~/lx_ros/src
	$ git clone https://github.com/amor-ros-pkg/rosaria.git

	$ cd ~/lx_ros
	$ catkin_make 

	This will most likely fail, this has to do with finding the Aria.h
	So, try this instead (from Reed)

	$ catkin_make --force-cmake	
	 
	

5) configure and test gmapping and navigation demos (by saturday morning)

	first copy the packages from old lx (lx_2dnav, lx_setup_tf, ttu_camera) into source directory of ne workspace, lx_ros

	also, add thill user to dial group before you can use serial ports, remember you have to log out then log back in for this to work!

	$ sudo adduser thill dialout

	install the keyboard drive node (need updating I think)

	$ sudo apt install ros-kinetic-teleop-twist-keyboard

	install 'navigation' stack ( i thought this came with ros-desktop-full...)

	$ sudo apt install ros-kinetic-navigation

	now build the workspace with catkin

	$ catkin_make


	Boom CASH! woop woop! I am very happy that we are this far at least ! - TH
	This is a big slightly a big deal because this is the first time the LX has run on Ubuntu 16 (MATE) - it seems to be a little smoother without unity desktop
