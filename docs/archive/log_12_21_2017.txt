  Goal: get stereo vision working with two usb cams 


  progress so far - LOTS - needs documentation

$ roslaunch weld_detection two_usb_cam.launch

$ rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.025 right:=/usb_cam0/image_raw left:=/usb_cam1/image_raw left_camera:=/usb_cam0 right_camera:=/usb_cam1 --approximate=0.1


 This works I guess you could say that...looks like crap though

    $ roslaunch weld_detection two_usb_stereo.launch

    now in rviz look at "/usb_stereo/points2" - as a pointcloud2



  Now it works A LITTLE better. At least the data is sensible. 
  So Try this! (In 3 separate terminals)

    $ roslaunch weld_detection two_usb_stereo.launch

    $ rosrun image_view stereo_view stereo:=usb_stereo image:=image_rect _approximate_sync:=True

    $ rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure

  Now in rviz look at "/usb_stereo/points2" - as a pointcloud2

    It is working but it is super sensitive to the parameters ...


   I am goin to try to calibrate them separately to see if that helps...

   $ roslaunch weld_detection usb_cam0.launch
 
   $ rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.025 image:=/usb_cam0/image_raw camera:=/usb_cam0

   then

   $ roslaunch weld_detection usb_cam1.launch
 
   $ rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size 8x6 --square 0.025 image:=/usb_cam1/image_raw camera:=/usb_cam1

   Now Try again - Looks like calibrating as monocams does not work at all...
