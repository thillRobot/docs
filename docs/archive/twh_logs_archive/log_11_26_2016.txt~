TWH ROS LOG - 11/26/2016 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL : develop a class to help 'part handling'





		1) Start here

			$roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage 
			$rosrun using_classes cpp_class



	So what is next ?

		Let us build up this class!

			


		i) lets make a backup of both workspaces today (new one and old broken one)

			- ~/ttu_ros -> ttu_ros_researcher3_11_26_2016.zip
			- ~/catkin_ws_arch -> catkin_ws_researcher3_11_26_2016.zip

			these just went to cloudland!


		i) now lets build up this class

			first i am just going to add a few more subscriber callbacks

			we now have a class with callbacks for 
			
			- goal status
			- amcl pose

			- clock (this is not working) but it does need to, there is an easeier way

				ros::Time now = ros::Time::now();
				ROS_INFO("Current Time=[%i]\n",now.sec
