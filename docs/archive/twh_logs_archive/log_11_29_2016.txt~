TWH ROS LOG - 11/29/2016 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL : develop a class to help 'part handling'





		1) Start here

			$roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage 
			$rosrun using_classes cpp_class



	So what is next ?

		Let us build up this class!

			

		i)  publish goal in a member function

		ii) get transforms working in the class






	WHOA! After ubuntu updated, turtlebot sim broke! But I fixed it! You just have to move a launch file!

		
		error: 

while processing /opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/amcl.launch.xml:
Invalid roslaunch XML syntax: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/amcl.launch.xml'
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

		fix: 

	cd opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/amcl
	sudo cp amcl.launch.xml /opt/ros/indigo/share/turtlebot_navigation/launch/includes/

	I think I may have to move the others as well in the future. 




	accompished: (NOT much)

		split cpp_class into 2 classes. 

			1) sub_class.cpp (subscriber) (works great!)

			2) pub_class.cpp (publisher) (doesnt work at all :( )
