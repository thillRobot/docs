TWH ROS LOG - 11/25/2016 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL : who knows





	Accomplished:

		1) somehow I wrecked the workspace, it would not make! (catkin_make) I think this happened when I tried $ catkin_make when I was not on the internet. I am not sure this is what caused the issue ( i hope that is not the issue because i would like to be able to compile w/o network but whatev)


		2) built a new workspace called 'ttu_ros' the old one is now saved as ~/catkin_ws_arch 

			created 3 packages 
			
			i) turtle_payload
			ii) publish_goal
			iii) using_classes

		3) try this
			
			$roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage 
			$rosrun using_classes cpp_class



	So what is next ?

		Let us build up this class!
