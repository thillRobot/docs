Axis 211A cam - 192.168.1.100

Problem 1 fixed - https://askubuntu.com/questions/10741/how-to-set-up-dual-wired-and-wireless-connections 

check 'use this conection only for resources on its network

Now I can have the camera and the internet !!

  installed axis camera fro ROS

	$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-axis-camera
 
  tested camera on local machine (T410)

	$ roscore	
	
	$ export ROS_NAMESPACE=axis   (not sure about this one)

	$ rosrun axis_camera axis.py _hostname:=192.168.1.100 _password:=tturobotics

	now you can see the topics published

	$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/axis/image_raw _image_transport:=compressed

        Now let us see if we can get the image over to the command computer (t1600)

	ON THE ROBOT COMPUTER (where the camera is)

	$ roscore

	$ export ROS_IP=10.100.66.XX
	$ export ROS_NAMESPACE=axis    	
	$ rosrun axis_camera axis.py _hostname:=192.168.1.100 _password:=tturobotics

	ON THE REMOTE COMPUTER (desktop)

	$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.100.66.XX:11311
	$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=remote_computer_name
	$ rosrun image_view image_view image:=/axis/image_raw _image_transport:=compressed

	This is currently working! The image does not seem to load in rviz however.I think that might be cause it is compressed.
