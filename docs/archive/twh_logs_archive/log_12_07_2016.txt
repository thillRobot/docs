TWH ROS LOG - 12/07/2016 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL : develop a class to help 'part handling'





	Accomplished : Send the robot to a series of goals that are stored in an array. Not perfect but it is working!
 
			To do this I have made a 'turtlebot_task' class. 			
		
			$roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage 
			
			$rosrun turtlebot_payload turtlebot_task





	To do: 
		1) move workspace to Dropbox 
						- This is done, testing in progress, the new catkin_ws is:  ~/Dropbox/ttu_ros
					     	- also I have changed my turtlebot_payload pkg name to ttu_turtlebot
						- these changes need to be installed on the dell notebook too :(


				so now try:

					$roslaunch turtlebot_stage turtlebot_in_stage

					$ rosrun ttu_turtlebot turtlebot_task

					OR

					$ rosrun ttu_turtlebot turtlebot_gripper
					
		
				these are both working but need more work !

		

		2) fix start up issues (in constructor)

		3) fix exit issues, console hangs up on ctrl-c (FIXED HALFWAY- step 4 below fixed this issue!)

			- if the task.visit_goals() function is completed and we return to main then i can exit cleanly with ctrl-c
		
		4) series of goals as a clean function call (clean up main) (DONE)
