TWH ROS LOG - 03/16/2017 

 to do: 

	MAIN GOAL : Learn more about the Nav Stack using the LX, layers plugings, parameter tuning

		1) Let us clean up the files first before we go much further DONE

		2) combine these two launches into one, possibly, maybe call them from a third ehh..  DONE

			-> $ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_config.launch

			-> $ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_move_base.launch 

		   now use this launch file, but the others still might be nice for debugging
		
			-> $ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_navigate.launch	

		3) set the IP address in just one place, can we make this work with the hosts file NOT DONE

		4) show the planned paths in rviz

		5) test setting the pose from rviz NOT WORKING


	ACCOPLISHEDL: I have added all three standard layer plugins, all three need parameter tuning

			- static_map
			- obstacles
			- inflation 
	
       STILL TO DO: Investigate the planner, I believe I am using the 'default' planner, S.Z. reccomends using 'teb_planner'
