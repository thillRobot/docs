# hello-world
This is a test!

I am just learning to use Git properly. I think that is crazy! - TH

This is the 'master' branch. - TH


Here is a simple workflow for GitHub through bash

Step 1) Clone the repository into the directory of your choice, this should create the 'master' branch

	$ cd <parent directory of repository>

	$ git clone <repo web address>


Step 2) Make a "devel" branch, this is a copy that we can test in. 

	$ git branch <branch name>

	$ git checkout <branch name>


Step 3) edit a file somehow - "do some work"


Step 4) Add and Commit any files to the 'devel' branch
	
	$ git add <file name>
	
	$ git commit -m "<add your comments here>"


Step 5) Change to the master branch and merge

	$ git checkout master'

	$ git merge devel' merge the branches

Step 6) Push to the main repository (to the web!)  

WOOP!

I know this needs work, but it is a start! - TH

I think this is awesome!
