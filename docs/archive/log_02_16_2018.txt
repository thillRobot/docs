    Processing the pointcloud data from the aubo Arm and the rpLidar ...

Try this:

    I now have a .pcd to .pcd voxel filtering process ... greatly reduces data size

    $ roslaunch seam_detection filter_cloud.launch in_file:="test_cloud2.pcd" out_file:="out_cloud2.pcd"



    You should see the both clouds in rviz 

    To check that it was saved properly you can look at the .pcd with pcl_viewer (if you have apt-get working!!!!) (and you must be in the right directory...)

    $ pcl_viewer -multiview 1 out_cloud2.pcd
