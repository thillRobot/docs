TWH ROS LOG - 08/09/2017 

  

  Goal: continue with the rtabmap tutorials 

  Also: need to figure out why my launch file is not working! (DONE - added lines below to ~/.bashrc)

   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/ros/indigo/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH



	NOW TRY THIS:

        thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera start_kinect.launch

     	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera start_rtabmap.launch

	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ rtabmap-databaseViewer ~/.ros/rtabmap.db

        go to view>3D view then you have to navigate around to see the map
  
        the go to file->export 3D map-> and save it somewhere

     	then open 'meshlab' it can be installed with apt-get, file->import mesh-> pick your file and see how awesome it is !


       Now I am starting the 'mapping on a remote computer' tutorial.


        I pulled a new 'rtabmap.launch' into the /opt/ros/indigo/share/rtabmap_ros/launch/ folder and saved the old one as instructed in the tutorial


   NOW TRY THIS:

        ON THE ROBOT COMPUTER (the kinect is plugged into the external usb port on LX)

       thill@robot:~$ roslaunch ttu_camera lx_3dmap.launch

	ON THE LOCAL COMPUTER

       	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.100.66.13:11311
	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=robotlab-t1600
       	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ export ROS_IP=149.149.151.59

	thill@robotlab-t1600:~$ roslaunch rtabmap_ros rtabmap.launch rgb_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image depth_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_image_depth camera_info_topic:=/camera/data_throttled_camera_info compressed:=true rtabmap_args:="--delete_db_on_start"
	
	Now you should see the mapping in the ttabmapviz window! Woop Woop!

	To do next: Figure out why my launch file (start_rtabmap.launch) is not working.
